Generic ESQL-Utilities for IBM Message Broker
Tested with Version 6 and 6.1

Motivation: 
When you use Message Broker you might find out that ESQL-Code probably is the best utility to use when tranforming messages. It is specialized and well fitted for the task, it is quick in transforming messages due to it's c-code-base and changes are easier trackable in source control than with graphical- or XML-based nodes. And ...most importantly... it allows you to code around and debug the tricky parts which other transformation nodes wouldn't let you do that easily.

If you agree with that then there only are some missing function that you'd just like to have in ESQL itself. I want to list these functions in hope IBM puts them nativly into ESQL or at least to promote sharing of these functions so that they are not lacking or need to be reimplemented on each project:

(1) references.esql: Utilities for reference handling. E.g. MOVE REF should be extended to allow moving along full paths (not just single elements). There should be a flexible syntax "language" to do different things (append, start from root, go to first element, go to last, ...)

(2) strings.esql: There should be more String-Manipulationfunctions based on the ones existing in Message Broker like

(2.1) countCharInChar
(2.2) xml2Env
(2.3) isAlphanumeric, isAlphaOrNumeric, isFieldReference, isIdentifier, isNumeric, containsCharsOnly
(2.4) getSubstring
(2.5) padding

(3) aggregate.esql: In-Message-Aggregation should be supported by a utility function "AGGREGATE(ref, path, field, value)"

(4) SORT() should be included (based on quick sort and using the extended MOVE REF internally).

(5) EMAILING of Messages should be better supported including various forms of attaching the Message and flexible definition of eMail-Recipiens:

(5.1) Attachments:
(5.1.1) There should be a checkBox to attach the MsgTree as xml. Currently there is the need for coding and creating a proper Blob.
(5.1.2) There should be a checkBox to attach the MsgTree using an MRM definition
(5.1.3) There should be a checkBox to attach the MsgTree as text within the body (some code for IA07)
(5.1.4) There should be a checkBox to attach the MsgTree flattend down to a file "CSV", e.g. for opening in MS-Excel.

(5.2) Recipients
(5.2.1) There are regular: e.g. "someone@mqseries.net" but there should also be groups: e.g. "myRecipientsList1", which gets resolved by a db-lookup

[... more to follow]

If someone comes up with more good utilities I am happy if you can enhance the code or we can collaborate on github.
